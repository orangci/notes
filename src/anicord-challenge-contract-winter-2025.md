***This post contains spoilers for the entirety of A Place Further Than The Universe. You have been warned.*** This is for the Challenge Contract in the Anicord event server.

God bless you, contractor. I had assumed this would be just another cute CGDCT full of fluff — which isn't a bad thing, mind you — but this threw my expectations over the ice.
Sora Yori is about four girls, each of whom have their own reason to want to go to Antarctica. It goes into detail of the stories of each girl, and covers different struggles they all go through. Their friendship is tested and grows by leaps and bounds. Oh, and it's also super cute.

***I loved it***. Unlike some CDGCT (again, not that I dislike other CGDCT because they're peak), they actually *do* things in Sora Yori. The plot is amazing. I especially love the captain, she's a great person and I appreciate how her and Shirase addressed things between each other. 

I loved the way the three friends mutually came together to celebrate Yuzu's happy day, I love how they each got so worried about Shirase and her mom, I love how Shirase told Hinata's former clubmates to piss off— friendship makes me happy. :D

Also, I really couldn't have asked for a better ending. The scenes I just mentioned and the ending made me emotional a bit. The humour in Sora Yori was also great.. *Final warning, I'm looking at you, Toshio! They're **not legal**!*


Best girl is Hinata, of course.

Final score; 10/10, and I booted Arslan Senki from tenth position in my favourites list and replaced it with Sora Yori.
