Communication is one of the important parts of human society. Without a proper system of communication established, an army will fall into chaos and disorder and even massacre, like the charge of the Light Brigade, a British cavalry unit that charged into their deaths at the hand of the Russian artillery due to a communication failure in the Battle of Balaclava in 1854. It resulted in 250 casualties across the span of just a few minutes.

We started with verbal speech, developing languages, and we did this for a mighty long time. As writing systems developed, paper and ink became cheaper, and literacy rates grew higher, we sent each other letters. The invention of the typewriter was a great boon to this effect, and then came the invention of the telegram and finally the telephone, a modern miracle.

And in our 21st century: the internet.
