According to my friends and reviews on MAL, YLIA is one of the saddest anime out there, and is supposed to make you cry. In that particular regard, it did not hold up to the expectations. I'm not too surprised there, there are very few pieces of media that have managed to get me a little teary. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy YLIA— it was really good. It has a good grasp on emotional struggles and portrays them very well.

Moving on, something I noticed before I started watching YLIA was the Love Polygon tag on MAL. I *do not like love polygons* so I was skeptical, but unlike other anime where they're very annoying — girls always fighting over one dude — this was actually interesting. It feels like actual thought was put into portraying how the chracters *felt* and what they were going through, instead of the usual stuff.

I had worried that because the internet spoiled me on YLIA's ending (I have a feeling this happens to everyone though) I wouldn't be able to enjoy it properly. But the hints that Kaori would die started dropping quite early in the anime so I realized that the internet spoiling me wouldn't be a big deal if it was already kinda obvious that it would happen. To me the most emotional part of the anime wasn't Kaori's death, but the scene where Saki is on her deathbed, crying because she couldn't give enough to her son— that combined with Arima remembering that his mother never hated him — really made me feel things.

The animation and sound (I was called a criminal multiple times because yes, I did mute the music scenes because I'm religious but let's forget about that for now), were great. The mouths' designs were funky but I didn't dislike them. It's definitely a unique art style.

I enjoyed it. 8/10.
